//Prep 3.2

//Make a program similar to GradebookHashMap, but which takes in students names and ID numbers (as integers)
// instead of names and grades. In this case, however, the keys should be integers (the IDs)
// and the values should be strings (the names). Modify the roster printing code accordingly.
